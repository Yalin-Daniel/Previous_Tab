## 🔍 The Problem

When you have dozens of tabs open, it's easy to forget where you just were.  
Maybe you were reading something, got distracted, and switched tabs — then you ask yourself:

> “Where was I just now?!”

Chrome doesn't have a built-in "go to previous tab" button – only back/forward within a single page.
